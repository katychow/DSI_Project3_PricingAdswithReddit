    "The **_objective_** of Project 3 was to be able to use classification methods and run an experiment on whether or not one could predict the correct subreddit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is starting to sell advertising space in subreddits.  They want a tiered structure to pricing based on post popularity.  (eg. if a post is more popular, it will cost more for ad space within a subreddit) It seems as though while we are very good at predicting the correct subreddit, we are not very good at predicting the up votes.  Perhaps a better marketing strategy would be to predict which subreddits are the most popular on the hot page and price advertisements based on the subreddit.\n",

    "## Data Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scraped from subreddits are the [psychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology) and [mental health](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth) subreddit.  \n",

    "  * NB2 contains code to run models to classify subreddit data and determine if the title of a subreddit is either mental health or psychology, some visualizations at the end from using sentiment analysis\n",
    "  * NB3 contains code to run adhoc visualizations including word cloud code and also lots of histograms\n",
    "  * NB4 contains code to run models on prediction of 'ups' given a specific subreddit\n",
